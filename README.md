## Feedback form

This app is inspired from https://firstrankreviews.com/
The review form is sent to the clients for their rating, if the rating is neutral or lower then the client will be sent a message that the business will improve on the basis of their feedback but if the rating is satisfied the client will be directed to Google Business Page of the company to provide their 5 star reviews there.

# What I learnt from this project:

I learnt to navigate the DOM, and to get to other elements within it using the bubbling method.
Here, the client needs to click on the image, whose parent is the 'rating' in the html DOM(using the bubbling method) because of which which, it takes the client to next action.
